**Welcome to the Backend Setup Guide**

This guide will help you set up the backend component of our application. Follow these instructions step by step to ensure a smooth installation process.

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**: 
   Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where the backend code is located.

2. **Install Dependencies**: 
   Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure MongoDB URL**: 
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the backend. Inside this file, add the MongoDB connection URL. For example:
   ```
   MONGODB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name
   ```
   Replace `your-database-name` with the name of your MongoDB database.

4. **Start the Backend Server**: 
   Once all dependencies are installed and the MongoDB URL is configured, start the backend server using the following command:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the backend server, and it should now be accessible at the specified port.
